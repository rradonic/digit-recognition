### Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

A translation of Michael Nielsen's Python code from the book ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), into Typescript.

It uses the [MNIST training dataset](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) from Yann LeCun et al.
